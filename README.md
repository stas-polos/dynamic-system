### dynamic-system

Based on the conducted research, two types of dynamic systems are considered: discrete and continuous. The developed algorithm is aimed at determining and investigating the output characteristics of a complex controlled positive dynamic system in both cases. The result of this work is a software product implemented in the C++ programming language and utilizing the Qt libraries. This product automates the process of obtaining solutions for the tasks of defining and researching output characteristics for both discrete and continuous positive dynamic systems.
